# Product Sans
The new Google logo and identity system was developed by creating a custom, geometric sans serif called Product Sans.

Simple, humble, and approachable, Product Sans was created from scratch to pair seamlessly with Google logo in a variety of contexts and product lockups without overshadowing it.
Additionally, it complements the new identity by introducing a primary branding typeface that is different in style and character from other interface text elements used in Material Design.

Despite being visually indistinguishable from its older brother, Google reported that Google Sans is actually the same font but optimized to work at different sizes.
The original Product Sans was only intended for Google’s official product logos.
